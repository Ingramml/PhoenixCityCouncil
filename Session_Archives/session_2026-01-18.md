## Files Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `.gitignore` | Modified | Added `.claude/`, `master-files/`, `*.csv` exclusions |
| `Documents/context.md` | Created | Project context tracking |
| `Documents/project-config.md` | Created | Technical configuration template |
| `Documents/project-goals.md` | Created | Strategic goals template |
| `Documents/session-goals.md` | Created | Session objectives template |

## Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Using symlink-based master-files architecture (not copying)
2. **Structure**: Standard project layout with Session_Archives, Documents, logs directories
3. **Git Exclusions**: Excluding `.claude/`, `master-files/`, and `*.csv` from version control

---

## What Didn't Get Done

- Project goals definition (template created but not customized)
- Tech stack configuration (template created but not customized)
- Development planning

---

## Next Session Focus

1. Define project goals in `Documents/project-goals.md`
2. Configure tech stack in `Documents/project-config.md`
3. Plan initial features for Phoenix City Council data collection
4. Begin development

---

## Technical Notes

- Symlink verified with `->` arrow in `ls -la` output
- Pre-flight checks validated master-files installation
- No real `master-files/` directory created (symlink only)
